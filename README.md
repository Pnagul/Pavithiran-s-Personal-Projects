# Pavithiran's Personal Projects

Thank you viewing my projects! This repository contains `3 projects`, each in a different folder.

## Overview of the 3 porjects

- **CPS209 project**: Includes all the java & class files required to run the project `MyAudio`. `MyAudio` is a sound management simulator created for my Computer Science II (CPS 209) course. This program, similar to Spoitfy, supports the administration of numerous audio formats, such as music and audiobooks, in a virtual library. It also communicates with a simulated online storeÂ to download and manage audio content.
  
- **CPS412 project**: Includes 2 files, a python script & Excel spreadhseet file. The python script uses python libraries such as numpy to analyze the data from the speadsheet and generate grapghs to visualize the findings of the survey & excel sheet has all the responses and datat collected from the audience.
  
- **Customize Your Own Colour** - This is my very first personal project that is outside coursework/university cirruculum! This project showcases a Python desktop application developed with Tkinter, enabling users to create custom RGB color codes through an intuitive and visually appealing GUI. It utilizes object-oriented programming, event-driven techniques, and input validation, ensuring a seamless user experience.
